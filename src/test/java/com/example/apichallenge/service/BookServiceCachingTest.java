Its ease and power have revolutionized application development from monoliths to microservices. Yet Spring Boot's simplicity can also be confounding. How do developers learn enough to be productive immediately? This practical book shows you how to use this framework to write successful mission-critical applications. Mark Heckler from VMware, the company behind Spring, guides you through Spring Boot's architecture and approach, covering topics such as debugging, testing, and deployment. If you want to develop cloud native Java or Kotlin applications with Spring Boot rapidly and effectively--using reactive programming, building APIs, and creating database access of all kinds--this book is for you. Learn how Spring Boot simplifies cloud native application development and deployment Build reactive applications and extend communication across the network boundary to create distributed systems Understand how Spring Boot's architecture and approach increase developer productivity and application portability Deploy Spring Boot applications for production workloads rapidly and reliably Monitor application and system health for optimal performance and reliability Debug, test, and secure cloud-based applications painlessly\",\n" +

What You Will LearnGet to know the Spring Boot and understand how it makes creating robust applications extremely simpleUnderstand how Spring Data helps us add persistence in MongoDB and SQL databasesImplement a websocket to add interactive behaviors in your applicationsCreate powerful, production-grade applications and services with minimal fussUse custom metrics to track the number of messages published and consumedBuild anything from lightweight unit tests to fully running embedded web container integration testsLearn effective testing techniques by integrating Cucumber and SpockUse Hashicorp Consul and Netflix Eureka for dynamic Service DiscoveryIn Detail Spring Framework has become the most popular framework for Java development. It not only simplifies software development but also improves developer productivity. This book covers effective ways to develop robust applications in Java using Spring. The course is up made of three modules, each one having a take-away relating to building end-to-end java applications. The first module takes the approach of learning Spring frameworks by building applications.You will learn to build APIs and integrate them with popular fraemworks suh as AngularJS, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Data. You will also learn to build microservices using Spring's support for Kotlin. You will learn about the Reactive paradigm in the Spring architecture using Project Reactor. In the second module, after getting hands-on with Spring, you will learn about the most popular tool in the Spring ecosystem-Spring Boot. You will learn to build applications with Spring Boot, bundle them, and deploy them on the cloud. After learning to build applications with Spring Boot, you will be able to use various tests that are an important part of application development. We also cover the important developer tools such as AMQP messaging, websockets, security, and more. This will give you a good functional understanding of scalable development in the Spring ecosystem with Spring Boot. In the third and final module, you will tackle the most important challenges in Java application development with Spring Boot using practical recipes. Including recipes for testing, deployment, monitoring, and securing your applications. This module will also address the functional and technical requirements for building enterprise applications. By the end of the course you will be comfortable with using Spring and Spring Boot to develop Java applications and will have mastered the intricacies of production-grade applications. Style and approach A simple step-by-step guide with practical examples to help you develop and deploy Spring and Spring Boot applications in the real-world.\",\n" +
